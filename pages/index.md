# Introduction

### &lt;1kb virtual DOM - it's fast!

Current Virtual DOM implementations are inadequate—Ranging from overcomplicated to abandoned, most are unusable without sacrificing raw performance and size. Million aims to fix this, providing a library-agnostic Virtual DOM to serve as the core for Javascript libraries.

## Hello World Example

Below is an extremely simple implementation of a Hello World app using Million.

```js
import { m, createElement, patch } from 'million';

// Initialize app
const app = createElement(m('div', { id: 'app' }, ['Hello World']));
document.body.appendChild(app);
// Patch content
patch(app, m('div', { id: 'app' }, ['Goodbye World']));
```
